Hi, this is the homepage! I'm Oliver, and I'm also still trying to decide exactly what should go on here. Also the layout is almost definitely going to change, but it's dependent on what else I'm going to put on here.

you can actually find the repo for this site there, right now I'm just using AngularJS but thinking about maybe adding some scrolling things with scrollmagic and sound with howlerjs. The site runs on an aws ec2 instance with an apache server.
